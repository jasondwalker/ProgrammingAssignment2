## For Programming assignment 2, R Programming, Coursera.
## A pair of functions. The first caches the inverse of a matrix, the second either retrieves
## this cache (if available) or solves the inverse if not.


## 1) Create a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## 2) Computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {

}
